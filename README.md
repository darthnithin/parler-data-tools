# Parler-Data-Tools

This is a collection of python scripts and methods to parse/process/analyze bulk WARC file data from the Parler web scrap archive

## Dependencies

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the various dependencies required for these scripts.

```bash
pip install hurry.filesize internetarchive bs4 warcat
```

## Usage

Most of these scripts are not meant to be used standalone. This is a collections of methods and code snippets that can be added to other scripts in most cases.

We are working very fast to get this stuff into a usable state for the public, but there is much work to be done.  It is unlikely you will be able to use these tools currently unless you have a basic understanding of the Python programming language and the WARC file format.

 We have tried to make sure the methods are broken into usable tools that can be utilized in whatever tool you may be building.
